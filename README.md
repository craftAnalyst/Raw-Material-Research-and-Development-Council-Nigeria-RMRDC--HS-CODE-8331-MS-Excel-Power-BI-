# Raw-Material-Research-and-Development-Council-Nigeria-RMRDC--HS-CODE-8331-MS-Excel-Power-BI-  
This Data Analysis project utilizes Microsoft Excel for extensive data cleaning and Power BI for data visualization to gain valuable insight into import items by Nigeria Customs based on tariffs, taxes, and import/export regulations from 2021-2023, also relationship between variables for strategic decision making.  

HS CODE 8331 - 2021-2023   

This project was given to me in September, 2024, to analyze by the lead analyst in the organization so as to be presented to stakeholders for strategic decision making.  
ðŸ”¹This is a Project on HS Code 8331 Records from 2021-2023 exploring the relationship between variables.  
ðŸ”¹HS code is an abbreviation for harmonized system code, it is a standardized numerical method of classifying traded products.  
ðŸ”¹It is used by customs authority and international organizations to identify products for the purpose of applying tariffs, taxes, and import/export regulations.  
ðŸ”¹In this project we will be exploring on the product types, cored wire base metal for electric ack welding, coated rods and cored wire of base metal for soldering, brazing or welding by flame
and other articles of heading 83.11, seeing the relationships between variables.

This report presents insights derived from analyzing import data using Power BI. The analysis covers product values and quantities, trends over time, the impact of exchange rates, and
performance by HS code and importers. The findings highlight key product types and import patterns from 2021 to 2023.  
The slicers positioned at the topmost right of the report provide dynamic filtering capabilities, enabling a deeper exploration of the data. By adjusting these slicers, users can uncover
detailed insights across various dimensions.  

## Import Analysis  
ðŸ”¹The analysis reveals that Core Wire Base of Metal is the leading product by both value (â‚¦8.95B, 83.92%) and quantity (12.22M kg, 75.92%). It is followed by Core Rods and Core Wire
(â‚¦1.07B, 10.07%; 2.89M kg, 17.92%) and other products (â‚¦640.87M, 6.01%; 990.63k kg, 6.15%).  
ðŸ”¹Breaking down by HS codes, HS Code 8311100000 leads with a value of â‚¦6.40B (60.02%) and quantity of 10.97M kg (68.12%). HS Code 8311200000 follows at â‚¦2.54B (23.83%) and
2.89M kg (17.93%), while HS Codes 8311300000 and 8311900000 account for smaller shares in both value and quantity.  
ðŸ”¹Average value and quantity trends show Core Wire at â‚¦5.02M and 7.44k kg respectively, making up the largest share of imports. Other Articles (â‚¦1.56M, 3.68k kg) and Coated Rods
(â‚¦1.34M, 2.68k kg) trail behind.  
ðŸ”¹From 2021 to 2023, overall import quantity grew significantly from 3.58M kg to 6.48M kg in 2022, before slightly declining to 6.04M kg in 2023. Core Wire exhibited consistent growth in
value and quantity, while Coated Rods saw an increase in 2022 but declined in 2023. Other product categories maintained minimal trends. Exchange rate fluctuations had a significant
impact, particularly on 2023 values.  
ðŸ”¹Top importers by quantity include Mangal Industry Ltd (1.88M kg) and African Natural Resources and Mines (1.48M kg). By value, Dangote Cement Plc (â‚¦1.18B) and Daewoo Engr. &
Construction Nig Ltd (â‚¦1.08B) led, with African Natural Resources and Mines Ltd also featuring prominently in both categories.  

## General Observations  
ðŸ”¹Total transactions across the years maintained parity at annual intervals.  
ðŸ”¹2022 saw a significant increase in both value and quantity, followed by a slight reduction in 2023.  
ðŸ”¹Cored wire dominated imports in both value and quantity, showing consistent growth over time.  
ðŸ”¹Coated rods showed moderate growth but lacked stability in value and import capability.  
ðŸ”¹Other products remained minimal in terms of importation and value.  

## Recommendations  
ðŸ”¹Focus on optimizing import strategies for core wire products due to their high contribution to value and quantity.  
ðŸ”¹Monitor exchange rate impacts on import costs and consider strategies to mitigate risks.  
ðŸ”¹Investigate reasons behind the decline in coated rod imports and explore ways to stabilize this category.  
ðŸ”¹Strengthen relationships with top-performing importers like Dangote Cement Plc and African Natural Resources and Mines to sustain growth.
